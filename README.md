# Portfolio Project

I am currently in the process of developing a portfolio website for myself using Bootstrap and React. This academic endeavor involves creating a visually appealing and responsive website that showcases my skills, projects, education, and experience. By leveraging Bootstrap's pre-built components and responsive grid system, I can easily structure and style my website. React enhances interactivity and allows for the creation of reusable components. Throughout the development process, I am ensuring a user-friendly navigation system, attention to design aesthetics, and proper showcasing of my academic achievements. By following best practices and continuously testing, I aim to create an impressive and professional portfolio website.
